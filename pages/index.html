<h1>Why does this exist?</h1>
<p>
    When I originally wanted to get into modding SkaterXL, I found that resources were sparse and unorganized over the
    modding Discord and other resources, so I decided to document and centralize the information I gather in my journey
    for future modders to better enjoy the learning process of getting into modding the game, and help grow, maintain
    and make order in the knowledge gained by the veteran modders in the community.
</p>

<h1>Who is this for?</h1>
<p>
    This is intended for beginner & veteran modders as one.
    The guides and documentation should cover everything from setting up your development environment, and up to useful
    / common game functions which may be used frequently when creating mods for the game.

# üõ†Ô∏èüõπ SkaterXL Modding Documentation 

__DISCLAIMER__: This is a community driven documentation and __not__ official documentation of the game's code.

This repository holds the source for the SkaterXL Modding documentation github pages website.

This website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) , using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for rendering & currently styled with the [Just The Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) theme.

## Contributing

In order to contribute, please push your changes onto the `dev` branch, and then open a pull-request to the `master` branch.
This will allow actions to perform tests on the `dev` branch automatically before being able to complete the merge.

## Building, serving & developing locally

In order to build and serve the website locally for development, follow the installation steps [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), and then go to the cloned repository directory and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and browse to http://localhost:4000 .

## TBD:
- Add some guides (transfer useful info / links from modding discord to be under the guides section)
